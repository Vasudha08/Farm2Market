# Farm2Market
**Overview:**

The app aims to connect farmers directly with consumers, enabling farmers to showcase their diverse range of products such as fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products, poultry, and more and consumers to browse and purchase directly from them. By facilitating direct transactions and eliminating intermediaries, the app empowers farmers economically and promotes fair trade practices. 
 
**Consumers** can make informed choices based on the transparent information provided by farmers, and the app can facilitate individual delivery arrangements or connect users with local delivery services. The app can offer communication channels for buyers and sellers to discuss any specific needs, negotiate prices, or arrange for customized orders. 

Once the purchase is finalized, the app can facilitate individual delivery arrangements or connect users with local delivery services to ensure efficient and timely delivery. Overall, the app fosters sustainable agriculture, supports farmer livelihoods, and provides consumers with access to locally sourced goods.
